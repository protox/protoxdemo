# Instructions

To use this demo file simply download **protoxdemo.dem** and place it into **...\Steam\steamapps\common\Rust\demos directory**, if demos directory doesn't exist create it.

Launch Rust & press F1 to bring down Console

Type **benchmark_demo protoxdemo** and hit enter to start the benchmark

The demo runs just under 2 minutes

To get average FPS, go to **...Steam\steamapps\common\Rust\benchmark** find the latest **.json** file (it will have a date) and open it in a text editor such as Notepad. You should see for example *"avgfps": 69.72196**, In this case the average fps for my system was 69.72 frames per second.

*You will notice there are issues with terrain and roads, this is because the map file is missing. Each update of Rust seems to generate new map file versions so including one is pointless.*
